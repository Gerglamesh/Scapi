Simple Chord API and Web Page

A simple web page and api that serves chord diagrams for guitar based on user selection.
There are plans to build on this in the future to also include chord progressions, circle of fiths and some kind of chord progression generator. Would also like to add functionality to add some music theory based chord thingies... will update when more ideas come to mind!
